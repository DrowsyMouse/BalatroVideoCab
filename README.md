# Balatro Video Cabinet
This project is intended to detail and create code and hardware with goal of creating a Balatro themed video cabinet.

Goals:
Measure, design and create a cabinet and monitor setup using the Ainsworth 560 video cabinet as inspiration
Discuss and create mods for Balatro to add to the authenticity and feel of the cabinet. Current mindset is leaning towards a score tracker and multiple player profiles for local competitive play.
Release any creations as GPL/public license for others to use and create their own Balatro themed setups.
